PDL-CholeskyPP

Cholesky decomposition decomposes a positive definite matrix A (any square
matrix such that for all column vectors v, v->transpose() x A x v > 0) into a
triangular matrix U such that U->transpose() x U = A.  It can be thought of as
a matrix square root.

This module implements the cholesky decomposition in pdlpp, without any
external depencies like LAPACK or GSL.  It was written b/c there was no
dependency-free implementation.

    use PDL::CholeskyPP;

    my $chol = $posdef->cholesky();
